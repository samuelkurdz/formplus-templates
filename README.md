###  `Testing*: npm test`

I am have not being able to write comprehensible test for the applicatin I believe this is the only
thing I have not done. I aim to write the testing by using Jest with react-testing Library.

I aim to start with simple tests such as
- tests for the presence of the search, filter and sort form inputs
- test for the paginators
- test to ensure some tangible information is always displayed, be it the templates or message that there was an error or finally empty templates which do not meet search/filter queries made by the user.

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
